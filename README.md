# Release promotion and GitOps

In this task we will look how we can handle releases and their promotion when using GitOps and Kubernetes.


## Guidance

1. Create a Kubernetes Cluster (may be provided)
2. Install your GitOps Operator of choice (may be provided)
3. Read [the story](STORY.md)
4. Read the [notes](NOTES.md)
5. Review what Alice and Bob have brainstormed.


## Additional task

* Alice and Bob have already been busy and have implemented and documented their first draft for the new workflow. You can find their work in [arch](arch), [argocd](argocd) and [.github](.github). As a first step, it can be helpful to look at these files, get them working and then build on them
* Think about what Tom may suggest when the guys go to the meetup :)
